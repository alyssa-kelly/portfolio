## Welcome!
My name is Alyssa Kelly and I'm a data analyst based in Richmond, VA. In this repository, you'll find some of my recent Python projects. Any folder that begins with `cc` is an assignment completed while earning my Data Analytics and Python cerficiation from FreeCodeCamp.org. Unmarked folders are personal projects.
